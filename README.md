# ADT Viewer UI

This is a Custom C# Console User Interface I built to help visualize the adding and removal steps for the ADTs covered on Exam 2 in Data Structures for Min Priority Queues / Binary Heap and Dictionaries / Hash Tables. I hope this is useful in preparation for Exam 2 for Data Structures.
